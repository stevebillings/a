## Java

My primary langage for professional use for the last 15 years has been Java. To see an example of code for which I was the primary developer:

## C++ / Robotics

For the last year+ I have been developing robotic software in my spare time using C++. It took a while to develop my C++ skills to the point I could develop reasonably good code. This repository is getting to the point where I feel pretty good about it:

A brief history of my explorations into robotics:

* Early in my career I did some robotics using what I believe was pretty standard at the time: C or assembly code running on a simple cyclic executive.
* When my interest in robotics revived about a year ago, I assembled a simple wheeled robot with a ping sensor and an arduino-based controller (very reminiscent my early robotics work, and laughably limiting compared to how modern robots are developed).
* After learning more about how modern robots are developed, I shifted my attention to Robotic Operating System 2 (ROS 2), and started developing robots (only simulated at this point) on ROS 2. Early experiments were conducted in my ros2overlays repo. From that I extracted some code and created the loiterbot repo. As my thinking on the robot I wanted to create changed, I eventually moved the code to the more appropriately named wanderbot repo.
